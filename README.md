This repository contains instructions (a spec file) for packaging devilspie2
for Fedora. It was tested from Fedora 21 to 23, but should work for future
versions or EPEL 7 (at least).

The easiest way to build a clean and working binary package is to use Mock.
Instructions can be found on the [Fedora Wiki on Mock](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Using_Mock_to_test_package_builds).
